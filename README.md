FAST: Framework for Automated System Tests

Goal
====
FAST is developed to automate routine system tests against continuously changing software.

Features
========
FAST provides
- Scheduler to run the latest or specified test packages against software ready to production.
- Parallel test runs over multiple processes and multiple hosts to shorten test suite running time
- Runtime configuration e.g., memory usage, time limit, to simulate tests on various practical runtime environments
- Management tools for 
    - FAST administrators to set up test suites which are composed of test software packages, and
    - Software development teams (software developers, test engineers and project managers) to access and analyze test results

Implementation
==============
FAST is mainly implemented in Java
